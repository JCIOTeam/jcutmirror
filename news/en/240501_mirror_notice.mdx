## Mirror Site Maintenance Notice

Dear users:

We would like to inform you that due to a backend Ceph OSD service issue, we are scheduled to perform emergency maintenance from **00:00 to 20:00 on May 2, 2024**. During this time, you may experience the following issues:

- Delays in cache updates for some mirrors
- Slower access speeds

We are committed to minimizing the maintenance duration to mitigate any inconvenience and to ensuring that service is restored to normal as swiftly as possible once maintenance concludes. We suggest scheduling your large data downloads outside of the maintenance window.

If you encounter any issues during or after the maintenance period, please do not hesitate to contact our technical support team.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
