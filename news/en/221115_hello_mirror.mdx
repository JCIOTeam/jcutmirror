After development and testing, the new UI design of Jingchu Institute of Technology open source software image station in the new school year 24-02-28 officially launched! The new mirror station is constructed and maintained by [JCIOT Team of Jingchu University of Technology Information Office](https://www.JCIOT.cc/), and provided by [JCIOT Team of Jingchu University of Technology Information Office](https://net.jcut.edu.cn/). It has more mirrors, a newly designed front-end website and management back-end, and a more robust mirror synchronization service, welcome to use!

### New design of the mirror station

In 2023 we in ` ` https://mirrors.jcut.edu.cn provides mirror stands 1.0 services, the domain name in the future also will continue to provide services, And the mirror station site documentation will all use the version of the domain name (` ` https://mirrors.jcut.edu.cn. You can visit the official website of Jingchu Institute of Technology Open Source image site to find and download the software image package and configuration file.

### Open source

We currently have the mirror stand used by [the front-end] (https://github.com/JCIOTeam/jcutmirror) and back-end (https://github.com/JCIOTeam/tunasync) code open in [JCIOT Making organization] (https://github.com/JCIOTeam), to welcome you all star ðŸŒŸ!

Want feedback?

All relevant JCUT mirror request, fault reports, and other you to JCUT mirrors improvements can be in our warehouse] [special issue feedback (https://github.com/JCIOTeam/ISSUE). Look forward to hearing from you.

### New sailing
Up to now, JCUT Mirror has been designed, optimized and built for nearly a year, and has completed the front and back end and resource response design of the mirror station.
The new site adopts a new and colorful modern modular design, using the high-speed equipment network of colleges and universities, and has basically reached the design speed after testing, and the theoretical school can basically reach 800M/s.

The construction of open source software mirror station is a difficult and great thing, fortunately, there are many predecessors have made great contributions to China's open source cause.

On this occasion, we once again thank MirrorZ Education Network joint Mirror station team, ZJUSCT of Zhejiang University, TUNA of Tsinghua University, HITLUG team of Harbin Institute of Technology,
The Linux Users Association of the University of Science and Technology of China and many other predecessors provided a beacon of guidance for the advent of JCUT Mirror today.

We hope that we can light up the road of developers with our weak light, and contribute to the acceleration of China's open source cause and the mirror package in Central China.

Materialist dialectics holds that the future is bright and the road is tortuous.
In the future, we will listen to the voice of society, absorb the opinions of teachers and students, and collect the mirror resources that you need as much as possible.
Realize infinite possibilities on limited hardware equipment, and help the development of China's scientific cause.

Thanks for choosing JCUTMirrors, and have fun developing them.
